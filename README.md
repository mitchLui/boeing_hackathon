## 1.2. Our Team

Our team (named Rogue One after the fact that we were team 1 and Star Wars is awesome) consists of 6 people from the University of Bristol, all of whom are from Hong Kong:

- [Mitch Lui][2] (Computer Science, 1st year)
- [Otis Lee][3] (Electrial and Electronic Engineering, 1st year)
- [Javis Lo][4] (Aerospace Engineering, 1st year)
- [Kieron Keung][5] (Aerospace Engineering, 1st year)
- [Ken Young][6] (Aerospace Engineering, 1st year)
- [Dominic Chu][7] (Finance, 1st year)

## 1.3. Our Project

We created a live vessel tracker using a REST API from [Datalastic][8]. Using Datalastic's data and Python library `gmplot`, we created a containerised Docker application using `FastAPI`. This enables us to put markers onto a google maps interface and track marine vessels in real time, as well as display information about a certain port.

## 1.4. Tech Stack

**Application**:

The application was deployed using Docker Compose.

**Front-end**:

The front-end is a FastAPI application that returns a Google Maps interface with vessel / port markers using the `gmplot` library

**Back-end**:

The back-end is also a FastAPI application that returns information about a vessel using the Datalastic API.

## 1.5. Deployment

### 1.5.1. Requirements

- Docker (and Compose)
- Install dependencies in `application/requirements.txt` and `backend_api/requirements.txt` using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` (For development) 
- A .env file under `application/` to store a Google Maps JS API Key
- A .env file under `backend_api/` to store API Keys for OpenWeather and Datalastic 

Samples for the .env files can be found in the respective directories.

### 1.5.2. Creating the compose network

The `docker-compose.yml` assigns port 80 to the front-end and 5000 to the back-end by default.

To deploy:

```sh
./make_compose.sh
```

---

## 1.6. Usage

The endpoint is `/marine_tracker` and the only parameter is `city`, which can be any city from the following list:

- felixstowe
- southampton
- london
- immingham
- liverpool
- portsmouth
- brisbane
- hong_kong
